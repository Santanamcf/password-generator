# password-generator
Overview: 
    My motivation to build this project other than it being assigned to me of course, was because I saw this assignment as a puzzle or game that I needed to solve. With this password generator you can now develop original passwords at the touch of a button. This lets you develop passwords that you won't repeat throughout multiple accounts. Through the culmination of this project I learned many new things pertaining to javascript, namely when to apply certain properties, such as concat and how to shorten that to the += to accomplish the same goal. When and how to apply forloops was also a very helpful thing to know going forward.

Project Description: 
    This project is a password generator that creates original passwords at the click of a button. I used 2 functions and a few variables in order to keep code simple and concise. The main challenge I faced while making this password generator was getting the password to display as a defined value. I fixed this by creating a new variable and pushing all of my code in the for loop into an empty string and defining that string in a return value. Some features I'd like to add in the future are a password strength meter, as well as a copy password button.
